# Cleanup Mlflow
A `cleanup-mlflow` task is available to wipe the mlflow server clean of experiments and models generated by the `bechdel_test_predictor` code. If you want to delete experiments or models from mlflow, this command should be used instead of manually deleting them in the mlflow UI. This task contains a `mlflow gc` call which removes all deleted experiment and model metadata. If you just delete experiments or models using the UI, this metadata is not removed and it can cause issues with subsequent mlflow experiment runs.

```sh
make cleanup-mlflow
```
